# Apprenticeship_Hiring_Difficulty
Repository for my project of Applied Labor Economics : "Are Apprenticeship Contracts a Remedy for Hiring Difficulties?"

This folder contains the two programs I used to carry out my work (also available on the repository).

"Data Processing" includes the code that downloads the "Base Tous Salari√©s" from 2018 to 2020 and aggregates the necessary information at the firm level to create a new dataset.

"Main" uses this newly created dataset to build relevant variables for my analyses. Then, there is an econometrics section where I combine the different variables I created into models, followed by a short descriptive statistics section.
